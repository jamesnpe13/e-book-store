Description:
Another tour de force from Jodi Picoult, Lone Wolf examines the wild and lonely terrain upon which love battles reason. Edward Warren, twenty-four, has been living in Thailand for five years; a prodigal son who left his family after an irreparable fight with his father, Luke. Then he gets a frantic phone call: his dad lies comatose, gravely injured in the same accident that has also injured his younger sister, Cara. With her father's chances for recovery dwindling, Cara wants to wait for a miracle. But Edward wants to terminate life support and donate his father's organs. Is he motivated by altruism, or revenge? And to what lengths will his sister go to stop him from making an irrevocable decision? Lone Wolf explores the notion of family, and the love, protection and strength it's meant to offer. But what if the hope that should sustain it, is the very thing that pulls it apart? 'Haunting and powerful ... takes you to another place.' Canberra Times
