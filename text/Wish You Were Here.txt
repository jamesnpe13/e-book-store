Description:
In the breathtaking beauty of the Galapagos Islands, Diana will learn who she really is, and the person she wants to become, in Jodi's deeply moving novel about the resilience of the human spirit.
Diana O'Toole is perfectly on track. She will be married by thirty, done having kids by thirty-five, and move out to the New York City suburbs, all while climbing the professional ladder in the cutthroat art auction world. She's a junior appraiser at Sotheby's now, but her boss has hinted at a promotion if she can close a deal with a high-profile client. She's not engaged just yet, but she knows her boyfriend Finn, a surgical resident, is about to propose â€“ days before her thirtieth birthday. Right on time.

A near-death experience brings Diana abruptly back to familiar city surroundings, where she tries to pick up the threads of her old life. Has she changed or have the people around her? Diana is no longer prepared to be just a follower, at work or in her relationships. She breaks down years of a stunted relationship with her mother, takes the initiative in her career, and looks at Finn through new eyes.

Jodi Picoult's matchless ability to portray the full gamut of human emotions is once again on display, along with her characteristically meticulous research into today's burning issues.
